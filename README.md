[![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-kristasutton-0072b1?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristasutton/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristasutton/)  <p align='left'>As the daughter of a tech enthusiast, I grew up around and with loads of technology and have always wanted to delve into the tech world. Mostly having worked in the customer service industry, this was slow going, but I have always been a quick study and would teach others how to use their own technology. 

After a minor car accident, I could no longer work in customer service the way I had in the past, and until recently I had thought this limitation meant that I wouldn't work at all. However that all changed when I found TripleTen's Business Intelligence Analyst program. This 4-month BIA bootcamp was right up my alley and scratched all the itches my brain had for making data beautiful and functional while allowing me to put my communication skills to work. 

In this program I delved into real world problems and solved them using Excel, SQL  and Data Visualization with Tableau. Collaborating with fellow students on study projects, we tackled real-world business cases, utilizing data to drive improvements and achieve tangible results.

Now equipped with proficient skills in Data Visualization with Tableau, Excel and SQL I am eager to apply my expertise. 

Apart from my professional pursuits, I enjoy fiber arts, mostly knitting and crochet as well as gaming with my husband and listening to books. In my free time I am also active in my community volunteer work, teaching people about God and the Bible. </p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1nP_-PxFx7r2dmM7wYgisdwgPJK-89b/view?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
